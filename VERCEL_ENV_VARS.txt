VERCEL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES TO SET
=====================================

Go to: https://vercel.com/manish-yadavs-projects-8d2de205/chat/settings/environment-variables

Add these TWO environment variables:

1. REACT_APP_API_URL
   Value: https://chat-production-75fa.up.railway.app

2. REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL
   Value: https://chat-production-75fa.up.railway.app

After adding both:
- Click "Save"
- Go to Deployments tab
- Click "..." on latest deployment
- Click "Redeploy"

This will make your Vercel frontend connect to your Railway backend!
